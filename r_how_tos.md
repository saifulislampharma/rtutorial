## how to install a package

    install.packages("package_name)
    
there are a lot of options to this method. like c++


## how to load a library
    library(package Name)

## how to see all the loaded library

    library()
  
## only base packages
  
    library(lib.loc = .Library)
  
## how to get the name of methods in a given package

    library(help = splines)
## how to get structure of an object

    str(obj_name)
    # can also use 
    summary(obj_a)
    
## how to see the files in current directory

    dir()
    
## how to find a specific pattern in current directory
    ls(pat = "specific_pattern)

## how many data types are there
![r](r_data_types.jpg)


## setting name attributes 
    
    names(obj) <- value
    
    # or if u want to see the names
    
    names(obj)
    
## Data Structures
![data structure](r_data_structures.jpg)


## what is order of corercion
The ordering is roughly logical < integer < numeric < complex < character
so logical will be integer

## to check class of any object

    class(obj_name)
    
## if have time, investigate the typeof() function


## how to initialize vectors
![vector initialization](r_vectors_init.jpg)

## how to index vectors
the upper limit of the range is also included in the result
![vector index](r_vectors_index.jpg)

![vector index](r_vectors_index2.jpg)

## how to reverse elements of a vector
    
    rev(x)
## how to replicate 

    rep(1,9)
    >[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
## Matrix initialization

![matrix iop](r_matrix_op2.jpg)


## list initialization
![list_initit](images/r_list_ini.jpg)

## list operation
`ls[[1]]` and `ls$a` return the same type of data. but `ls[1]` return a list
![list_operaton](images/r_list_op.jpg)
look at the example, this way we can also specify the name of element of a list
![list_operaton2](images/r_list_op1.jpg)


## how to create a dataframe

![DataFrame](images/r_df_init.jpg)

## how to subset the dataframe

we know the exact location of rows and columns

    ed_exp1 <- education[c(10:21),c(2,6:7)]

Another elegent way: if we know the value of specific column upon which to select rows, and the columns to be selected

    ed_exp2 <- education [which(education$region == 2), names(educations) %in% c("State","Minor.Population","Education.Expenditures")]
    
Another Basic function 
    
   ed_exp3= subset(education, region ==2, select =  c("State","Minor.Population","Education.Expenditures"))
   
Using dplyr

    install.packages("dplyr")
    library(dplyr)
    ed_exp5 <- select(filter(education, Region == 2),c(State,Minor.Population:Education.Expenditures))
    
1. Subset using brackets by extracting the rows and columns we want
2. Subset using brackets by omitting the rows and columns we donâ€™t want
3. Subset using brackets in combination with the which() function and the %in% operator
4. Subset using the subset() function
5. Subset using the filter() and select() functions from the dplyr package

## how to load/install packages if not already loaded/installed

        if((!require("ggplot2")){
        install.packages("ggplot2"))
        library(ggplot2)
        }


## different ways to input/output

### load: will load .rda files

.rda files save the r objects in binary format.

      save(count, age, circumference, file = "mydata.rda")
      #now load
      load("mydata.rda") # it wil search the file in directory returned by getwd()
      
### writing human readable files
[link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-save-and-load-datasets-in-r-an-overview/)

       write.table(data, 
                    file = "file.csv",
                    sep = "\t",
                    row.names = F,
                    append = F) # append = True will write the file at the end of already present in the disk. 
                    
if the file is huge:
       
       
       library(data.table)
       t0 = Sys.time()
       for (i in 1:10){
                fwrite(data, file = "file.csv",
                sep = "\t",
                row.names = F,
                append = T)
            }
        difftime(Sys.time(),t0)
        
if we want to write an excel file

          library(WriteXLS)
          WriteXLS(data, ExcelFileName = "data.xlsx",
                     SheetNames = "my data",
                     AdjWidth = T,
                     BoldHeaderRow = T)
                     
so basically three arguments are to be given. data, file, row.names.

here to write csv

                write.csv(data, file= "file.csv",
                row.names = F)
